Ok, so we are trying to make a system that is distributed and resilient.

If we want to store additional date its simpler to use an external existing distributed system.

At least get linux running.

Whitelist is good.

## Language

[MUST, MAY, SHOULD and others are used in accordance with RFC rules.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)

## Functional Requirements

1. A node may be set up on a linux device.
2. A node may have any external routing service (VPN, Proxy, OBFS4, etc...)
3. A node may have a connection to another node.
4. A node must have a whitelist of other nodes.
5. Another node must have a whitelist of external services.
5. A node is considered *trusted* if it is in the *whitelist*.
6. Traffic entering node A may exit at a *trusted* node B directed at an *external service*.
7. Any node trusts itself.
8. Any external routing target can be whitelisted.
9. A node must attempt to create a direct connection with another *trusted* node.

## Questions

- How should a whitelist work? Does it consider inbound nodes? Does it consider outbound nodes?
- How is the data transferred? Double-graph Problem
