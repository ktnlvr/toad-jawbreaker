# Path Discussion

- Dijkstra is good for single paths.
- Dijkstra fails for multiple routes, because if one root is even slightly suboptimal it will not be considered.
- Cache paths 
- Heartbeat every minute?

Problem with using BFS with naive universal bandwidth and proportional routing:

```
If A advertises to have bandwidth 5 then it might overcongest
if the traffic is distributed proportionally.

   3
  -> (B) -> (A 5)
             ^
   3         |
  -> (C) ----+
      | 
      v
     (D 1)
```

We can do dynamic advertising instead, so if we have real bandwidth and the advertised bandwidth. 

Imagine we have real bandwidth 6, but we only advertise 5. Then we get traffic from (B) and (C). We can all traffic from be, so 3 and 5/6 of traffic from C, so 5/2. This is 5.5, which is more than we advertise.

We can lower the amount, if we take 5.5/5 = 1.1, and then scale the advertised traffic to be 5/1.1 = 4.5, we can a lower amount of advertised traffic so a lesser share will go through the (A) node.
